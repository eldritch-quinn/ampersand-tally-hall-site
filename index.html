			<h2>About Tally Hall</h2>
			<p>Tally Hall is an American rock band formed in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in December 2002, and publicly active until the conclusion of their Good & Evil tour in 2011. The band is known for its upbeat melodies and whimsical lyrics. The members originally described their musical style as "wonky rock", later redefining their sound as "fabloo", in an effort to not let their music be defined by any particular genres after critics began defining the characteristics of "wonky rock".</p>
		</aside>
		<p>"Turn the Lights Off" speaks of dreams and nightmares; "You and Me" is about a relationship in turmoil; unlike the other tracks from Good & Evil, "&" is broader and deals with opposites in all its forms.  Musically, "&" features a catchy melody driven by a combination of acoustic and electric guitars, accompanied by a dynamic rhythm section and intricate vocal harmonies. The song's arrangement is characterized by its shifts in tempo and dynamics, creating a sense of tension and release that mirrors the ebb and flow of life itself.</p>
